# Project3

In this project I was trying to set up a grocery counter item system. My code takes items and sorts them based on names and the amount of said item. The overall goal is to make it easier for inventoring items and to keep track of sold items. The code is meant to take items and add them or subtract them based on items sold and brought in.

Sorting of items, is likely the best thing done with this code. 

My code could be used in any convenient stores or can be modded to work for just item and inventory control.

The most challenging part of the code was getting Python to be used in the code. It took some time and aid from my professor.

To make things more readable I cut down on Python code.
